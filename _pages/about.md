<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I graduated from Morehouse College in 2021. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in [SUPERgroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) working with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).

I am building interfaces that help illuminate fairness‑related decisions throughout the data science process and creating data‑processing techniques that operationalize theories of justice by incorporating knowledge of systemic inequalities.

Technology has historically found many new ways to oppress, harm and exploit marginalized peoples and my goals are to focus on supporting and developing outcomes that result in tangible benefits for those who are most negatively affected by the current trajectory of technology, governmental policies and society.


#### Other things I'm interested in:
- algorithmic audits as a means of implementing accountability
- protecting privacy rights in a surveillance economy
- photography
- baking
