I graduated from Morehouse College in 2021. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in [SUPERgroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) working with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).

I am building interfaces that help illuminate fairnessâ€‘related decisions throughout the data science process and exploring new  (and old) data processing techniques that operationalize theories of justice by critically engaging with the impacts of systemic inequalities on data.

#### Other things I'm interested in:
- evaluating privacy and transparency affordances online
- film photography
- baking
